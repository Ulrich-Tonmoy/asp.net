## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0) or later
- [Microsoft SQL Server Express](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Stripe Account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) (for payment processing)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-api.git
   cd ecommerce
   ```

2. **Configure the application**

   - Update `appsettings.json` in the `eCommerce.API` project:
     - Set your database connection string
     - Configure Stripe API keys
     - Update JWT settings

3. **Apply database migrations**

   ```bash
   cd eCommerce.API
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

4. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   dotnet run --project eCommerce.API

5. **Access the application**
   - API: `http://localhost:5139/api/`
   - Swagger UI: `http://localhost:5139/swagger/index.html`

## üîí Authentication

The API uses JWT for authentication. To access protected endpoints:

1. Register a new user via `/api/Auth/create`
2. Login to get a JWT token via `/api/Auth/login`
3. Include the token in the `Authorization` header for subsequent requests:
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token
   ```

## üìù Logging

Logging is implemented using Serilog with the following features:

- Console logging
- File logging
- Structured logging for better querying
- Log rotation

Logs are stored in the `Logs` directory by default.
